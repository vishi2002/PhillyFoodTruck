# PhillyFoodTruck
A Java/XML implementation that creates an App for Philadelphia College Students to find and keep track of their favorite food trucks in the area. I utilized a variety of aspects that AndroidStudio has to offer including the GoogleMaps API by storing coordinates in a virtual FireBase.

This application is an app that allows the user to scroll through a list of potential food trucks that are ordered by rating and see the address and type of food of each food truck. The user is then able to click on each food truck and see more details like a contact number, hours of service, etc. The application also includes a map button which if clicked takes the user to a map of Philadelphia with the food trucks marked. The map also asks the user for permission to share their current location, and then sets that location as a marker as well (as a reference point). If the user denies to give their current location the map stays centered at the location where the food trucks are present; however, if the user gives permission for the app to access their location the map zooms out to accommodate both the center of the food trucks and the current location.
